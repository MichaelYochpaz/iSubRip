>
> Support will not be provided for issues arising from using this package as a library.
## üõ† Configuration
A [TOML](https://toml.io) configuration file can be created to customize various options and features.

The configuration file will be searched for in one of the following paths based on your operating system:

- **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\.isubrip\config.toml`
- **Linux / macOS**: `$HOME/.isubrip/config.toml`

### Path Examples
- **Windows**: `C:\Users\Michael\.isubrip\config.toml`
- **Linux**: `/home/Michael/.isubrip/config.toml`
- **macOS**: `/Users/Michael/.isubrip/config.toml`


### Example Configuration
```toml
[downloads]
folder = "C:\\Subtitles\\iTunes"
languages = ["en-US", "fr-FR", "he"]
zip = false

[subtitles]
convert-to-srt = true
fix-rtl = true

[subtitles.webvtt]
subrip-alignment-conversion = true
```

An example config with details and explanations for all available settings can be found [here](https://github.com/MichaelYochpaz/iSubRip/blob/main/config.toml).

## üìú Logs
Log files are created for each run in the following paths, depending on your operating system:

**Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\.isubrip\logs`  
**Linux / macOS**: `$HOME/.isubrip/logs`  

Log rotation (deletion of old files once a certain number of files is reached) can be configured in the configuration file using the `general.log-rotation-size` setting. The default value is `15`.

For more details, see the [example configuration](https://github.com/MichaelYochpaz/iSubRip/blob/main/config.toml).
